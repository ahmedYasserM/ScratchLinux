# Scratch Linux

Here you can find notes about different linux topics.

## How to follow this guide?ðŸ“–

This guide is divided into different topics, each topic has a README file with the notes related to that topic.

I create a branch for each topic with all the unfinised notes, when I finish the notes I merge the branch to main.

If you want to see the unfinised notes you can switch to the branch of the topic, but If you want to get the latest ready to use notes you can use the main branch.

You can navigate through the topics using the table of contents.
