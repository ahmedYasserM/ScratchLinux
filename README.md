# Scratch Linux

Here you can find notes about different linux topics.

## How to follow this guide?ðŸ“–

This guide is divided in different topics, each topic has a README.md file with the notes. You can navigate through the topics using the table of contents.

I create a branch for each topic with all the unfinised notes, when I finish the notes I merge the branch to master.

If you want to see the unfinised notes you can switch to the branch of the topic, but If you want to get the latest ready to use notes you can use the main branch.
