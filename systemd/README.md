# Systemd

**Systemd** is the most popular **initialization systems** (also refered to as **init** systems). It is the default init system for most major Linux distributions nowadays.

System initialization time is reduced because services are started in parallel.

## Runlevels

Runlevels are a concept from the old **SysV init** system. They are a way to group services together. For example, runlevel 3 is the default runlevel for servers and runlevel 5 is the default runlevel for desktops.

You can think of a runlevel as a preset of services that should be running (A state in which the operating system is running)

### SysV init runlevels

| Runlevel | Name                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Systemd Unit Types

A **unit** is a resource that the system knows how to manage, consisting of a **name**, **type** and **configuration file**.

| Unit Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The Linux system unit configuration files are located in the following directories

1. `/etc/systemd/system `
2. `/usr/lib/systemd/system `
3. `/lib/systemd/system`

### Systemd Targets

**Runlevels** are called **Target Units** in **systemd**.

**Systemd** targets are similar to **SysV init** runlevels. They are a way to group services together. For example, the `multi-user.target` is the default target for servers and `graphical.target` is the default target for desktops.

| Target Unit          | Corresponding Runlevel      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **reboottarget**     | analogous to runlevel **6** | ðŸ“Œ Shuts down the system and reboots the machine                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Default Target

The default target is the target that is started when the system boots. The default target is analogous to the runlevel that is started when the system boots.

The default target is defined by a symbolic link at `/etc/systemd/system/default.target`. The default target is a symbolic link to the target unit that should be started when the system boots.

> NOTE
>
> Systemd will search for files in the following directories in the order listed below. If a file is found in an earlier directory, the file in the later directories will be ignored.
> 1. `/etc/systemd/system`
> 3. `/usr/lib/systemd/system`
